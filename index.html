            <h2>Here's a time line of Mahatma's life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1869 - Born at Porbandar, India</li>
                <li>1883 - Got married to Kasturba Makhandas Kapdia at a young age of 13, as per the prevalent regional
                    custom at that time.</li>
                <li>1888 - Dropped out of college and left to study law at London. His family was against his decision
                    to move to Londonfor studying law. They feared that he would abandon his religion and family after
                    going to Britain. But he dissuaded them by taking a vow that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and
                    women during his stusies there. He kept his words.</li>
                <li>1891 - Graduated as a Barrister from London and returned to India. Tried to establish a law business
                    at the then Bombay for 2 years but failed.</li>
                <li>1893 - Went to South Africa to work as a lawyer for a shipping company. He spent 21 years in South
                    Africa. This period turned out to be the turning point in his life. After sufferign the atrocious
                    racist regime first hand, he took up the cause of fellow Indians and tought them to fight back by
                    usisng non-violent means. </li>
                <li>1906 - Launched his idea of Satyagraha or They way of the Truth to protest against a new law
                    requiring compulsory registration of Indians and Chinese.</li>
                <li>1915 - Returned to India and joined the Indian National Congress. His orientaiton to Indian
                    political situation, Indian people and their issues happened under the tutelage of Gopal Krishna
                    Gokhal.</li>
                <li>1917 - His first major achievement came during the Champaran peasants movement of Bihar. Gandhi
                    squeezed out much of the demands of the peasants from the British authorities after successfully
                    leading a popular non-violent agitation.</li>
                <li>1930 - Gandhi organised the famous Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April, where he marched
                    388 kilometers(241mi) from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to make salt himself. Thousands of Indians
                    joined him on this march to the sea. Thiscampaign was one of his most successful at upsetting
                    British hold on India; British responded by imprisoning over 60,000 people.</li>
                <li>1942 - Gave a speech calling for the British to quit India for good. This speech was the precursor
                    to the most powerful yet non-violent Quit India movement against the British colonial oppession in
                    India. The British rulers understood that they must cede powers slowly and allow the Indians to
                    self-rule.</li>
                <li>1944 - He was given the popular title of the father of the nation by another legendary revolutionary
                    Subhash Chandra Bose from a radio broadcast from Singapore.</li>
                <li>1947 - India became independent of the British rule.</li>
                <li>1949 - Mahatma was assasinated by Nathuram Godse.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>"In my life i have always looked to Mahatma Gandhi as an inspiration, because he embodies the kind of
                    transformational change, that can me made when ordinary people come together to do extraordinary
                    things."</p>
